# This is the final submission of 526 project by Yanfeng Fang & Jiazhe Li.
# The python code is called "ECON_526_FinalProject_Code.py"
# The paper is called "Final Paper Submission - Yanfeng Fang & Jiazhe Li.pdf"

Improvements that can be made:

1.	Data spatial resolution: We only have city-level data, and the comparison will be better if we look at the county-level data.
2.	Time range of data: we don’t have access to the time before OCP, so we cannot make sure that observations are comparable to begin with.
3.	Data representation: We need GIS.
4.	Travelling distance: To improve accuracy of travelling, we may need to use the average driving distance rather than the shortest driving distance. Some of the most used lane, like guodao, may exists for a longer period of time.

As we care about the LR effect of OCP, we don’t necessarily need to be worried about the time of treatment to be just happened in the time range of data (Mellisa Dell (2010)). But, to make sure that the observations are comparable in the first place, we need to make sure #2 is improved.
